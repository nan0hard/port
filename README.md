Hi!!

This has code for my portfolio website.

Technologies used:

Frontend - React
Backend - Sanity.io

To run this code locally, you need to download this repo and run `npm install` in the root directory.
Use npm start to start the server.

For the backend part
use command `sanity start` to start the server.
